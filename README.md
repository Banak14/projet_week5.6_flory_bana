Vanguard Online Process Assessment

Overview

This project focuses on the assessment of Vanguard’s new online process, where we applied various data analysis techniques and tools to understand user behaviors and process efficiency. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, performance metrics, hypothesis testing, and experiment evaluation. We also used Tableau for visualizing the data, providing clear insights into the performance of the new design.

Key Objectives

Understand user demographics: Who is using the service and how their characteristics influence performance.

Analyze process completion rates: Measure user behavior and performance across various steps in the online process.

Evaluate error rates and time spent: Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

Conduct hypothesis testing: Determine the statistical significance of differences between control and test groups.


Data Analysis

1. Demographics Analysis

Age Distribution: The primary users are now in the 50-70 year age range, showing a shift towards a more mature user base.
Gender Distribution: Usage is relatively balanced between male and female users, with a notable portion not specifying gender.

Demographic	Key Insights

Age Group	Majority of users are aged 50-70 years.
Gender	Usage is balanced between male and female users, with a high unspecified gender count.
Tenure	Majority of clients have been with the service for 5-10 years.

2. Client Behavior and Completion Rates

Completion Rates: Both Control and Test groups show a decrease in users as they progress through the steps. The Test group ultimately has a higher completion rate (14.49%) than the Control group (12.34%).

Process Step	Control Completion Rate (%)	Test Completion Rate (%)
Start	32.29	31.56
Step 1	21.02	21.88
Step 2	18.34	17.49
Confirm	12.34	14.49

3. Hypothesis Testing

A T-test was conducted to evaluate if the differences in completion rates between Control and Test groups were statistically significant. The p-value (0.7388) suggests no significant difference.

4. Time Spent and Error Rates

Time Spent: Users spend more time on later steps of the process, with a notable increase from Step 1 (0m 56s) to the confirmation stage (3m 39s).

Error Rates: Error rates are highest at the start (15.15%) and decline as users advance through the process, with no errors recorded at the final confirmation step.

Process Step	Error Rate (%)	Average Time Spent
Start	15.15	1m 3s
Confirm	0.00	3m 39s
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Completion Rate: 

The Test group has a higher completion rate, suggesting positive effects of the new design.

Error Rates: High initial error rates need attention to reduce friction.

Time Spent: Time increases with each step, indicating areas where users might need more assistance or clearer instructions.


Recommendations

Optimize Early Steps: Focus on reducing errors in the early stages of the process to ensure a smoother user experience.
Test with Broader Demographics: Engage with younger clients and those with shorter tenure to ensure the process caters to a diverse audience.
Conclusion

The new design shows promise with a higher completion rate but still has areas for improvement, particularly in the initial steps where errors are prevalent. Future enhancements should focus on optimizing the early user experience and testing with a broader demographic to support Vanguard’s growth.
